Notes from the bicycle lock mount design process.

I am working on a mount for my bicycle U-lock. Up until recently, when I would
bike, I would hook my lock over my handlebars and hold it in place with my hand.
This was okay and I liked having the lock on my handlebars, but it was 
uncomfortable for my hand, and didn't feel very stable. My solution was to 3D
print a bracket to hold my lock on my handlebars.

I made the bracket with two pieces that are bolted together around the 
handlebars. In the original design I was planning on zip-tying the bracket
to the handlebars, but after printing it and riding with it, I decided I wanted
something more sturdy. I have to remember to make bolt holes larger than I think. 
For this design, I wanted the bolts to be able to slide freely through the bolt
holes and have them tightened only by the nuts, but instead they ended up screwing 
in and cutting some shallow threads. The holes for the lock also were small in the
first iteration.

I printed them with grey filament from a brand called Inland, which I picked up
for cheap from MicroCenter.

Here's how I printed them:
