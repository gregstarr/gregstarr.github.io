This project is to implement the following paper in Python: <http://cfg.mit.edu/content/chopper-partitioning-models-3d-printable-parts>

[View on Github](https://github.com/gregstarr/pychop3d)

I am doing this because I want to print an entire shoe rack, but I obviously can't fit a shoe rack in my 3D printer. I thought it would be cool to be able to desgin the shoe rack as if I could, then have this algorithm chop it up into printable parts for me. I searched online for their implementation but couldn't find it.
