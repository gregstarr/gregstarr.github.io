This project is to implement the following paper in Python: <http://cfg.mit.edu/content/chopper-partitioning-models-3d-printable-parts>

[View on Github](https://github.com/gregstarr/pychop3d)

I am doing this because I want to print an entire shoe rack, but I obviously can't fit a shoe rack in my 3D printer. I thought it would be cool to be able to desgin the shoe rack as if I could, then have this algorithm chop it up into printable parts for me. I searched online for their implementation but couldn't find it.

The the algorithm is well explained in the paper so I won't go into details here, but basically it is a greedy beam-search over possible planes with which to split the object. In the paper they define several different components of the objective function and their relative weightings. Every time the object is split, each section of the object is considered independently of the other. In this fasion, a tree is formed called a Binary Space Partition Tree. Planes are a good way to split the object because the resulting sections can always be reassembled. 

After the object is split, simulated annealing is used to determine where the connectors should be placed. Each potential connector site is a binary choice, and the combination of these choices are determined according to a different objective function which they also define. 

So far I have only implemented what seem to be the most important components of the objective funciton, and haven't optimized the code. My primary goal is to get the code to a point where it can chop up my shoe rack. After that, I can optimize the code and implement various features which will make it possible to chop up more objects. I have a web scraper script which downloads random items from thingiverse and attempts to chop them. This has been a great way to catch bugs so far.
