I am working on a case for the MKS Gen 1.4 3D printer main board. I will make a
more detailed post about this once it's finished.

So far, I like the case. The rectangular holes on the front serve two purposes:
they provide ventilation and they seperate the wires connected to the screw hole
terminals on the MKS Gen 1.4. There is also a hole in the back which lines up
with the slot cut in the bottom horizontal rail of the 3D printer. This is to 
feed the ribbon cable for the LCD and the wires for the z endstop through. As I
will mention in another post, I moved my z endstop to the print head in order
to make a 
[bed levelling sensor]({% post_url 2019-08-23-ender-3-bed-levelling-sensor %}).
